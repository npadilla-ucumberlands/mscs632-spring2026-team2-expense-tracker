# Feature Parity Checklist

Both implementations must support:

- [ ] Add expense (date, amount, category, description)
- [ ] Retrieve all expenses
- [ ] Filter by category
- [ ] Filter by date range (start/end, inclusive)
- [ ] Summary total (overall)
- [ ] Summary totals by category

Outputs should be comparable across languages (same fields, same date format).
